## Introduction

Severe weather events such as storms can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. In this report, the top ten events that caused the most population damage and economic damage are calculated and plotted.  

## Data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site. It can also be found at [noaa website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp).

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

## Assignment

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer two basic questions:

- Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
